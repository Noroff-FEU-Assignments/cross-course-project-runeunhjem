    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      There are almost too many threats out there today to name them all, so you
      will need to take web security into consideration already from the start
      of this project. It might take a little bit longer to finish, but you will
      get that back many folds going forward being secure against hackers and
      other vulnerabilities on the being present on the web.<br />
      I would suggest sanitizing data using the sanitize-html package in NodeJS,
      using open-standard authorization protocols, implementing CI/CD, network
      security, automatic user timeout, and 2-Step verification to ensure the
      end user is actually doing the act.
